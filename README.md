## About census tracts in Canada

*"Census tracts (CTs) are small, relatively stable geographic areas that usually have a population between 2,500 and 8,000 persons.
They are located in census metropolitan areas and in census agglomerations that had a core population of 50,000 or more in the previous census."*
